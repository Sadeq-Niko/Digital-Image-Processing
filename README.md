## Repository Highlights

The projects in this repository span many core topics in digital image processing, including:

- **Spatial Domain Processing**: Techniques applied directly on pixel values, including filtering, edge detection, and noise reduction.
- **Frequency Domain Processing**: Methods such as Fourier Transform for frequency analysis and filtering.
- **Grayscale and Color Images**: Operations on both grayscale and colored images, utilizing various color models (e.g., RGB, HSI).
- **Color Standards and Conversions**: Manipulation and transformation between different color spaces, like RGB, HSI, and YCbCr.
- **Feature Detection**:
  - **Haar Cascades**: Used for face and object detection tasks.
  - **Harris Corner Detector**: For identifying corners and other interest points.
  - **SIFT & SURF**: Advanced techniques for feature detection and description.
- **Histograms**: Analyzing intensity distributions and applying histogram equalization for contrast adjustment.
- **Wavelets and Pyramids**: Multiresolution analysis and image decomposition.
- **Image Manipulation**: Practical tasks such as resizing, rotating, and applying affine transformations.
- **Motion Capture**: Techniques for analyzing movement within multiple images.

This repository is structured to provide an in-depth look at each of these areas, making it an ideal reference for anyone interested in digital image processing or related applications.
